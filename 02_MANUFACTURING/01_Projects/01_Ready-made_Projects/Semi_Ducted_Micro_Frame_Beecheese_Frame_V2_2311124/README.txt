# Summary

This is a remix of my beecheeseframe based on stylesuxxÂ´s awesome cheeseframe.

Print it with 100% infill. You can print it pretty fast with still good results.

It will fit 8520 motors and 55mm props. The ducts are reduced to save weight and resized to fit bigger propeller.The 55mm props improve flight performance and flight duration alot, compared to the 50mm version. I got around 6 Minutes on 700mah 1s. It anyhow doesnt feel that agile, but has more power to compensate hard moves.

I did some reinforcment at weak points. It can take some hits and is easy to fix using superglue if something went wrong ;)

Update:
You may use my cam mount on your already printed frames.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2480571

Awesome flightcontroller firmware: 
Betaflight 3.1.6 Omnibus 
https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight
(Open Source)

Do not forget to break in your motors. (Around 1 lipo pack at min throttle, best way to do is on motors tab in betaflight configurator)

Specs:
Lenght: 120mm
Width: 139mm
Weight: 11.5 grams

Build video: (Frame V1 but same hardware as in V2) (english subtitles)
