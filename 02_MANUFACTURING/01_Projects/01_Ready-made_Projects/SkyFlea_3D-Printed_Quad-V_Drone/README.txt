Tips :

The design intended for drone equipped with components listed below. Different components with similar dimensions and specifications may be used. 

Battery compartment can easily house a 3s 40C 6200mAh battery,

Landing foot is taller than original IRIS+'s to clear newly designed battery compartment from ground.

Four micro ESC's, a 50x50mm 2-axis GBC board,  an APM/Pixhawk power module, 50x50mm power distribution PCB installed on the Bottom Plate.

Pixhawk flight controller (on vibration damping plate), telemetry radio, FPV transmitter, a piezo buzzer, I2C extender module installed on Top Plate.

GPS module, a receiver with two antennas, an APM/Pixhawk safety switch installed underneath/on the Top Shell.

à¸ºTo minimize EMF interference, bottom of GPS module should be covered by an EMI-shield cup, made from thin (0.1mm., or less) copper sheet, soldered and wired to battery negative (ground).

Print density : 50%. Reduce print density for lighter weight.

Printer : Delta, 210x210x320mm print volume.
 
Parts 1-3, 5-6, 8, 10 (2 off), 11-15, 16 (2 off), 17 (12 off), 18-19 printed from black ABS plastic.
Parts  4, 9, 10 (2 off), 16 (2 off) printed from blue ABS plastic.
Part 7 printed from clear PLA plastic.

Part 4 sanded and spray-painted blue for a glossy finish.

Use small rubber balls similar to this : https://hobbyking.com/en_us/vibration-damping-ball-65g-bag-of-8.html  for gimbal and flight controller (Pixhawk) vibration damping plates. 

Use M3 hex screws for assembly (except for LED/USB port PCB retainer, GPS module cover, and Gimbal IMU cover which are secured in place by small 1.5mm self-tapping screws) .

Use (original, replacement, or printed)  Mobius mounting base for mounting the camera onto gimbal top vibration damping plate.

Install M3 brass inserts, 4mm (OD), 3mm (H), in all mounting holes for M3 mounting screws.
